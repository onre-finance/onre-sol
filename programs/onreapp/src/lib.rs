/// The main program module for the Onre App.
///
/// This module defines the entry points for all program instructions. It facilitates the creation
/// and management of offers where a "boss" provides one or two types of buy tokens in exchange for
/// sell tokens. A key feature is the dynamic pricing model for offers, where the amount of
/// sell token required can change over the offer's duration based on predefined parameters.
///
/// Core functionalities include:
/// - Making offers with dynamic pricing (`make_offer_one`, `make_offer_two`).
/// - Taking offers, respecting the current price (`take_offer_one`, `take_offer_two`).
/// - Closing offers (`close_offer_one`, `close_offer_two`).
/// - Program state initialization and boss management (`initialize`, `set_boss`).
///
/// # Dynamic Pricing Model
/// The price (amount of sell tokens per buy token) is determined by:
/// - `sell_token_start_amount`: Sell token amount at the beginning of the offer.
/// - `sell_token_end_amount`: Sell token amount at the end of the offer.
/// - `offer_start_time`, `offer_end_time`: Defines the offer's active duration.
/// - `price_fix_duration`: The duration of each discrete pricing interval within the offer period.
/// The price interpolates linearly across these intervals.
///
/// # Security
/// - Access controls are enforced, for example, ensuring only the `boss` can create offers or update critical state.
/// - PDA (Program Derived Address) accounts are used for offer and token authorities, ensuring ownership.
/// - Events are emitted for significant actions (e.g., `OfferMadeOne`, `OfferTakenTwo`) for off-chain traceability.
