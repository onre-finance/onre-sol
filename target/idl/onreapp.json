    "This module defines the entry points for all program instructions. It facilitates the creation",
    "and management of offers where a \"boss\" provides one or two types of buy tokens in exchange for",
    "sell tokens. A key feature is the dynamic pricing model for offers, where the amount of",
    "sell token required can change over the offer's duration based on predefined parameters.",
    "",
    "Core functionalities include:",
    "- Making offers with dynamic pricing (`make_offer_one`, `make_offer_two`).",
    "- Taking offers, respecting the current price (`take_offer_one`, `take_offer_two`).",
    "- Closing offers (`close_offer_one`, `close_offer_two`).",
    "- Program state initialization and boss management (`initialize`, `set_boss`).",
    "",
    "# Dynamic Pricing Model",
    "The price (amount of sell tokens per buy token) is determined by:",
    "- `sell_token_start_amount`: Sell token amount at the beginning of the offer.",
    "- `sell_token_end_amount`: Sell token amount at the end of the offer.",
    "- `offer_start_time`, `offer_end_time`: Defines the offer's active duration.",
    "- `price_fix_duration`: The duration of each discrete pricing interval within the offer period.",
    "The price interpolates linearly across these intervals.",
    "",
    "# Security",
    "- Access controls are enforced, for example, ensuring only the `boss` can create offers or update critical state.",
    "- PDA (Program Derived Address) accounts are used for offer and token authorities, ensuring ownership.",
    "- Events are emitted for significant actions (e.g., `OfferMadeOne`, `OfferTakenTwo`) for off-chain traceability."
